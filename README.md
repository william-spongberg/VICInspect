# PTV Inspector Tracker

Despise inspectors and how they treat passengers, so here's a handy website to report the exact locations of them at all times. Use to check heatmaps of current locations, report inspectors and remember to share this with your mates!

> Currently a work in progress! Will always remain open source + open to contributers :)

## Details

- Google Maps for mapping ...maybe, still deciding on this. Don't love that it could cost me money
- Uses your location to pinpoint inspector locations
- PTV API to track current tram + train locations, so inspectors can be attached to those vehicles

## Framework

Vercel + NextJS + React + MUI
