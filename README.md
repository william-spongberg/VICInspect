# PTV Inspector Tracker

Despise inspectors and how they treat passengers, so here's a handy website to report the exact locations of them at all times. Use to check heatmaps of current locations, report inspectors and remember to share this with your mates!

- Uses your location to pinpoint inspector locations
- PTV API to track current tram + train locations, so inspectors can be attached to those vehicles
